# lizard-care
This is a static page meant to practice my CSS and HTML. The page is a made up company that takes care of lizards.
I first drew a layout of the page on a paper and thought about the best way to go about coding this site. I encountered 
a couple of difficulties, especially dealing with images, but I figured out how to fix them after snooping around on google.
I then made the website responsive by resizing the showcase area, the main and aside, as well as the form.
